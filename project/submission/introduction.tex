Our task in the course project was to utilize what we have learned on the course about unsupervised and supervised learning, different model selection methods and gaussian mixture models on a data set from US Forensic Science Service. The dataset contains samples of 6 different kinds of glasses with 9 different attributes to characterize them.

In the unsupervised approach we take the data and try to fit a model to it without prior knowledge of the data classes. The classifier is generated by trying to fit Gaussian Mixture Models with different numbers of clusters and then selecting among the generated models.

In the supervised approach we know the clustering of the training data and can use that information to generate the model. The knowledge of the classes is used to fit GMM for each of the classes separately. The classifier itself works so that the data is compared to each of the GMMs and the one which gives the highest likelihood.
